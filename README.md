# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_POPULAR_MOVIES_DATA

In collaboration with UNP, I developed the Popular Movies Dashboard which is an comprehensive analytical tool offering insights into movie trends and performance metrics. The dashboard analyzes movie genres, ratings, and user rating, highlighting top-rated and highest-grossing films. By categorizing movies and their ratings, the dashboard helps users identity popular genres and emerging tends. It explores user engagement, popular tags, genres and also the unique tags that are associated with movies providing a data-driven approach to understanding successful movie factors. The inclusion of ratings adds another layer of analysis.

Overall, the dashboard serves as a valuable resource which enables informed content recommendations and business decisions in the film industry, enhancing understanding of success factors in the industry.
